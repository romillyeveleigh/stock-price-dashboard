# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
# <body>
#
# <footer>

# Type should be one of the following:
# * feat (new feature)
# * fix (bug fix)
# * docs (documentation)
# * style (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
# * refactor (refactoring production code)
# * test (adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change)
# * chore (updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change)

# Scope is just the scope of the change. Something like (admin) or (teacher).

# Subject should use impertivite tone and say what you did.
# The body should go into detail about changes made.
# The footer should contain any JIRA (or other tool) issue references or actions.
